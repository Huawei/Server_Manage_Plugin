Overview:
This document introduces the installation and uninstallation of the Huawei OpenNMS plug-in, and how to use the plug-in to view the server's health status.
The OpenNMS plug-in can monitor Huawei severs.The major functions are as follows:
1,Records alarms and events from Huawei servers.
2,Monitor server SNMP Node Data: System Cpu Usage, System Power, Inlet Temperature.

Huawei Server Compatibility:
Supported Huawei servers: E9000 Chassis,RH1288 V3, RH2288H V2, RH2288H V3, RH2288H V3, RH5885 V3, RH5885H V3, RH8100 V3, X6000, X6000.

Prerequisites:
1, OpenNMS 19.0.1 or later has been installed. 
2, You have obtained the Huawei OpenNMS plug-in installation package,download from:https://github.com/Huawei/Server_Manage_Plugin

Installation£º
1,Log in to the OpenNMS server as root user.
2,Put the Huawei OpenNMS Plug-in package into the OpenNMS server under a path(such as /root).
3,Use the following command to extract the plug-in package:[tar -zxf ***.tar.gz]. Note:*** represents the name of the plug-in.
4,Into the file path after decompression:[cd ***],Note:*** represents the name of the folder after unpacking.
5,Use the following command to install the plug-in:[sh install.sh],then the following message appears:

"Please enter the OpenNMS installation directory[/opt/opennms]:"

  Note:If the OpenNMS installation directory equals /opt/opennms,Please enter "Enter", If the other installation directory,Please enter the appropriate OPENNMS_HOME directory.Then the following prompt appears to indicate that the plugin was installed successfully:

"The OpenNMS plugin was installed successfully."

  Note:If the following prompt appears to indicat that the plugin was installed failed.It maybe the OpenNMS installation directory you entered is wrong,Please re-run and enter the right path. 

  "Installed of OpenNMS does not exist or is not executable."

6,Restart OpenNMS use the following command:[OPENNMS_HOME/bin/opennms -v restart].

Uninstallation:
1,Please refer to the Installation step1-step4.
2,Use the following command to uninstall the plug-in:[sh uninstall.sh],then the following message appears:

"Please enter the OpenNMS installation directory[/opt/opennms]:"

  Note:If the OpenNMS installation directory equals /opt/opennms,Please enter "Enter", If the other installation directory,Please enter the appropriate OPENNMS_HOME directory.Then the following prompt appears to indicate that the plugin was uninstalled successfully:

"Uninstall the OpenNMS plugin successfully. "

   Note:Enter the right path,otherwise,Uninstallation will be failed.Please refer to the Installation step5.
3,Restart OpenNMS use the following command:[OPENNMS_HOME/bin/opennms -v restart].


Configuring a Server to Be Managed

Step1: Configure the SNMP service for the server
1,Configuring a rack server.
  Log in to iBMC web page.Go to this page:Cinfigure > System Settings > Set SNMP Version,to configure the SNMP parameters.
2,Configuring an E9000 server.
  Use Xshell to log in to the HMM, and set the SNMP version and community name of the HMM.
  root@SMM:/#smmset -d snmpconfig -v v2c enable
  WARNING:SNMP V2C has no user authentication mechanism and transmits data in plain text.
  Continue?[Y/N]:Y
  Success
  root@SMM:/#smmset -d snmpconfig -v community
  New Community:
  Retype new Community:
  Success

Step2: Configure the trap for the server. 
1, Log in to iBMC or HMM web page,Configure the trap parameters.
  iBMC:Go to this page:Alarm & SEL > Alarm Settings > Trap Alarm Notification Settings.
  Set Trap Function to ON,Trap Mode to OID, Set Trap Server Address to OpenNMS server IP, retain default values for other parameters, and click Save  
  HMM:Go to this page:Chassis Settings > Network Settings > MM.
  Click Edit,Set Trap to Enable,set Trap mode to OID,set Trap address to OpenNMS server IP,and click Save.

2,When you are using the SNMP Trap v3 protocol,You need to modify the contents of this file[$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/trapd-configuration.xml].
  The SNMPv3 credentials used to authenticate and decode V3 Traps must be specified in trapd-configuration.xml, as the following example: 
  
  <trapd-configuration snmp-trap-port="162" new-suspect-on-trap="true">
  <snmpv3-user security-name="opennms" auth-passphrase="0p3nNMSv3" auth-protocol="MD5"privacy-passphrase="0p3nNMSv3" privacy-protocol="DES"/>
  <snmpv3-user security-name="agalue" auth-passphrase="secret" auth-protocol="MD5"
      privacy-passphrase="super-secret" privacy-protocol="DES"/>
  </trapd-configuration>
