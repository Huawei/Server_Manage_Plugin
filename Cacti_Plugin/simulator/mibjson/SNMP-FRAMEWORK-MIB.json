    "description": "An SNMP engine's administratively-unique identifier. Objects of this type are for identification, not for addressing, even though it is possible that an address may have been used in the generation of a specific value. The value for this object may not be all zeros or all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length) string. The initial value for this object may be configured via an operator console entry or via an algorithmic function. In the latter case, the following example algorithm is recommended. In cases where there are multiple engines on the same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT appropriate, as it would result in all of those engines ending up with the same ID value. 1) The very first bit is used to indicate how the rest of the data is composed. 0 - as defined by enterprise using former methods that existed before SNMPv3. See item 2 below. 1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3 below. Note that this allows existing uses of the engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to co-exist with any new uses. 2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets. The first four octets are set to the binary equivalent of the agent's SNMP management private enterprise number as assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would be assigned '000002b8'H. The remaining eight octets are determined via one or more enterprise-specific methods. Such methods must be designed so as to maximize the possibility that the value of this object will be unique in the agent's administrative domain. For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP entity, or the MAC address of one of the interfaces, with each address suitably padded with random octets. If multiple methods are defined, then it is recommended that the first octet indicate the method being used and the remaining octets be a function of the method. 3) The length of the octet string varies. The first four octets are set to the binary equivalent of the agent's SNMP management private enterprise number as assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would be assigned '000002b8'H. The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the above value for Acme Networks now changes to be '800002b8'H. The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and following octets) are formatted. The values for the fifth octet are: 0 - reserved, unused. 1 - IPv4 address (4 octets) lowest non-special IP address 2 - IPv6 address (16 octets) lowest non-special IP address 3 - MAC address (6 octets) lowest IEEE MAC address, canonical order 4 - Text, administratively assigned Maximum remaining length 27 5 - Octets, administratively assigned Maximum remaining length 27 6-127 - reserved, unused 128-255 - as defined by the enterprise Maximum remaining length 27 "

An enterprise-specific securityModel value is defined to be: enterpriseID * 256 + security model within enterprise For example, the fourth Security Model defined by the enterprise whose enterpriseID is 1 would be 259. This scheme for allocation of securityModel values allows for a maximum of 255 standards- based Security Models, and for a maximum of 256 Security Models per enterprise. It is believed that the assignment of new securityModel values will be rare in practice because the larger the number of simultaneously utilized Security Models, the larger the chance that interoperability will suffer. Consequently, it is believed that such a range will be sufficient. In the unlikely event that the standards committee finds this number to be insufficient over time, an enterprise number can be allocated to obtain an additional 256 possible values. Note that the most significant bit must be zero; hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various organizations to design and define non-standard securityModels. This limits the ability to define new proprietary implementations of Security Models to the first 8,388,608 enterprises. It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded form, the securityModel value will normally require only a single byte since, in practice, the leftmost bits will be zero for most messages and sign extension is suppressed by the encoding rules. As of this writing, there are several values of securityModel defined for use with SNMP or reserved for use with supporting MIB objects.

To facilitate internationalization, this information is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8 transformation format described in [RFC2279]. Since additional code points are added by amendments to the 10646 standard from time to time, implementations must be prepared to encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff. Byte sequences that do not correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a code point or are outside this range are prohibited. The use of control codes should be avoided. When it is necessary to represent a newline, the control code sequence CR LF should be used. The use of leading or trailing white space should be avoided. For code points not directly supported by user interface hardware or software, an alternative means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be provided. For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the US-ASCII encoding. UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a single character / code point; thus the length of this object in octets may be different from the number of characters encoded. Similarly, size constraints refer to the number of encoded octets, not the number of characters represented by an encoding. Note that when this TC is used for an object that is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the number of sub-identifiers for any object instance does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC3416]. Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is measured in octets, not characters. "
