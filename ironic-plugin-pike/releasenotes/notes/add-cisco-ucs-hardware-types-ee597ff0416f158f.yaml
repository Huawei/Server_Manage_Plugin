    Adds two new hardware types to support Cisco UCS Servers,
    ``cisco-ucs-standalone`` and ``cisco-ucs-managed``.
    ``cisco-ucs-standalone`` supports driver interfaces for controlling UCS
    servers in standalone mode via either CIMC APIs or via IPMI.
    ``cisco-ucs-managed`` is a superset of ``cisco-ucs-standalone`` and
    supports additional driver interfaces for controlling the UCS server via
    UCSM.

    To support these hardware types the following Ironic driver interfaces were
    made available to be configured on a node:

    * ``node.power_interface`` can be set to:

      * ``cimc`` for CIMC API power control (power on/off, reboot, etc.)
      * ``ucsm`` for UCSM API power control (power on/off, reboot, etc.)

    * ``node.management_interface`` can be set to:

      * ``cimc`` for CIMC API management control (setting the boot device, etc.)
      * ``ucsm`` for UCSM API management control (setting the boot device, etc.)
