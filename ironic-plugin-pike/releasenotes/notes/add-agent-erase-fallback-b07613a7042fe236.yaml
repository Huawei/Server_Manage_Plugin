features:
  - A new configuration option
    ``[deploy]continue_if_disk_secure_erase_fails``, which
    has a default value of False, has been added. If set to
    True, the Ironic Python Agent will revert to a disk shred
    operation if an ATA secure erase operation fails. Under
    normal circumstances, the failure of an ATA secure erase
    operation results in the node being put in ``clean failed``
    state.
upgrade:
  - A new configuration option
    ``[deploy]continue_if_disk_secure_erase_fails``, which
    has a default value of False, has been added. The default
    setting represents the standard behavior of the Ironic
    Python Agent during a cleaning failure.
