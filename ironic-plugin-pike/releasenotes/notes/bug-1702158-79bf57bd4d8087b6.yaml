    Fixes database schema that could cause the wrong database engine to be
    utilized for the ``conductor_hardware_interfaces`` table, if the system
    is using MySQL prior to version 5.5 or the ``default_storage_engine``
    option is set explicitly to 'MyISAM' in ``my.cnf``.
    In this case, a table could be created with MyISAM engine, and the foreign
    key constraint ``conductor_id(conductors.id)`` was ignored.
    See `bug 1702158 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1702158>`_
    for details.

    Due to `bug 1702158 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1702158>`_,
    the ``conductor_hardware_interfaces`` table could be created with MyISAM
    database engine, while all other tables in ironic database are
    using InnoDB engine. This could happen during initial installation, or
    upgrade to the Ocata release, if the system was using MySQL prior to
    version 5.5 or the ``default_storage_engine`` option was set explicitly
    to 'MyISAM' in ``my.cnf``. If this is the case, the
    ``conductor_hardware_interfaces`` table needs to be manually migrated
    to InnoDB, and the foreign key constraint needs to be re-created::

      alter table conductor_hardware_interfaces engine='InnoDB';
      alter table conductor_hardware_interfaces
        add constraint conductor_hardware_interfaces_ibfk_1
        foreign key (conductor_id) references conductors(id);
