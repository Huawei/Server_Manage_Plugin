fixes:
  - A bug was identified in the behavior of the iLO drivers
    where nodes that are not active but taking part of a
    conductor takeover could be powered off.
    In preparation for new features and functionality,
    that risk encountering this bug, we are limiting the
    deployment preparation steps to the ``deploying``
    state to prevent nodes from being erroneously
    powered off.
