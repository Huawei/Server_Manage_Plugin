    The 7.0.0 release includes many new features and bug fixes. Please review
    the upgrade section which describes the required actions to upgrade your
    ironic installation from 6.2.2 (Newton) to 7.0.0 (Ocata).

    A few major changes are worth mentioning. This is not an
    exhaustive list:

    - "Port group" support allows users to take advantage of bonded
      network interfaces.
    - State change and CRUD notifications can now be emitted.
    - Soft power off, soft reboot, and sending non-maskable interrupts (NMI)
      are now supported in the REST API.
    - The AMT, iBoot, msftocs, seamicro, VirtualBox, and Wake-On-Lan drivers
      have been removed from ironic. Please see the upgrade notes for
      additional details and options.
    - "Dynamic drivers" is a revamp of how drivers are composed. Rather than a
      huge matrix of hardware drivers supporting different things, now users
      select a "hardware type" for a machine, and can independently change the
      deploy method, console manager, RAID management, power control interface,
      etc. This is experimental, as not all "classic" drivers have a dynamic
      equivalent yet, but we encourage users to try this feature out and
      submit feedback.
