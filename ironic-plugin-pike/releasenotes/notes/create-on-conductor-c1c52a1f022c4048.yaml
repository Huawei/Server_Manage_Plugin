upgrade:
  - Moves node creation logic from the API service to the conductor service.
    This is more consistent with other node operations and opens opportunities
    for conductor-side validations on nodes.  However, with this change, node
    creation may take longer, and this may limit the number of nodes that can
    be enrolled in parallel.
  - The ``[DEFAULT]/default_network_interface`` and ``[dhcp]/dhcp_provider``
    configuration options were previously required for the ironic-api service
    to calculate the correct "network_interface" default. Now these options
    are only required by the ironic-conductor service.
