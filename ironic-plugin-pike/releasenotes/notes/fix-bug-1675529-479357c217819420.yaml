deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[ipmi]/retry_timeout`` is deprecated in favor of
    these new options:

    * ``[ipmi]/command_retry_timeout``: timeout value to wait for an IPMI
      command to complete (be acknowledged by the baremetal node)
    * ``[conductor]/power_state_change_timeout``: timeout value to wait for
      a power operation to complete, so that the baremetal node is in the
      desired new power state
fixes:
  - |
    Prevents the IPMI driver from needlessly checking status of the baremetal
    node if a power change action fails. Additionally, stops retrying power
    actions and power status polls on receipt of a non-retryable error from
    ipmitool. For more information, see `bug 1675529
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1675529>`_.

    A new configuration option ``[conductor]/power_state_change_timeout``
    can be used to specify how many seconds to wait for a baremetal node
    to change the power state when a power action is requested.
