    Updates required proliantutils version for iLO drivers to 2.4.0.
    This version of the library comes with quite a few features:

    * Adds support for Gen10 servers using
      `Redfish <https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish>`_ protocol.
    * Provides support for one-pass disk erase using HPE SSA CLI through
      Proliant hardware manager in IPA.
    * ``local_gb`` defaults to 0 (zero) when no disk could be discovered
      during inspection.
