  - Adds support for generating `Guru Meditation Reports
    <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GuruMeditationReport>`_ (GMR) for both
    ironic-api and ironic-conductor services. GMR provides debugging
    information that can be used to obtain an accurate view on the current
    state of the system. For example, what threads are running, what
    configuration parameters are in effect, and more.
