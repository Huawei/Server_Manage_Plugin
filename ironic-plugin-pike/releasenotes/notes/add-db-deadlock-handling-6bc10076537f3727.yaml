fixes:
  - Fixes an issue which caused conductor's periodic tasks to stop executing.
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1637210.
features:
  - Adds DBDeadlock handling which may improve stability when using Galera.
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1639338. Number of retries
    depends on the configuration option ``[database]db_max_retries``.
upgrade:
  - All DB API methods doing database writes now retry on deadlock. The
    ``[database]db_max_retries`` configuration option specifies the maximum
    number of times to retry, and can be customised if necessary.
