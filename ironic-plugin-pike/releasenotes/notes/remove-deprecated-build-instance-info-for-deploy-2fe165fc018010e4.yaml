    The method ``build_instance_info_for_deploy()`` from the
    ``ironic.drivers.modules.agent`` module was deprecated in the Ocata cycle
    (version 7.0.0). It is no longer available. Please use the method
    ``build_instance_info_for_deploy()`` from the
    ``ironic.drivers.modules.deploy_utils`` module instead.
