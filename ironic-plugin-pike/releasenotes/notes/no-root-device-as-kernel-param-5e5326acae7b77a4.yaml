upgrade:
  - Ironic no longer passes ``root_device`` as kernel parameter via boot
    config files.
    Passing root device hints to Ironic Python Agent (IPA) as kernel
    parameters was deprecated in Newton release.
    As a consequence, using root device hints with Ironic as of Ocata release
    will not be possible when deploying nodes with the help of ramdisks based
    on IPA as of Mitaka release.
    Operators relying on root device hints functionality are advised
    to update their IPA-based Ironic deploy images.
