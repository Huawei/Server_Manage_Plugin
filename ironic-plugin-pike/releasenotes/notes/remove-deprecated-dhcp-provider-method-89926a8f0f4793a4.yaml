    Removes the deprecated DHCP provider method ``update_port_address``.
    For users who created their own network interfaces or DHCP providers
    the logic should be moved to a custom network interface's
    ``port_changed`` and ``portgroup_changed`` methods. The following
    methods should be implemented by custom network interfaces:

    * ``vif_list``: List attached VIF IDs for a node.
    * ``vif_attach``: Attach a virtual network interface to a node.
    * ``vif_detach``: Detach a virtual network interface from a node.
    * ``port_changed``: Handle any actions required when a port changes.
    * ``portgroup_changed``: Handle any actions required when a
      port group changes.
    * ``get_current_vif``: Return VIF ID attached to port or port group
      object.
