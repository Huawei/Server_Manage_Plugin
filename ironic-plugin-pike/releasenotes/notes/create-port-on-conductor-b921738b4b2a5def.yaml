upgrade:
  - Moves port creation logic from the API service to the conductor service.
    This is more consistent with port update operations and opens opportunities
    for conductor-side validations on ports.  However, with this change, port
    creation may take longer, and this may limit the number of ports that can
    be created in parallel.
