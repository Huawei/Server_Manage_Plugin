features:
  - Adds support for inter-service notifications (disabled by default until the
    ``notification_level`` configuration option is set). For more information,
    see the notifications documentation in the developer's guide
    (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/dev/notifications.html).
    Notifications are not actually emitted yet, but will be added in a future
    release.
