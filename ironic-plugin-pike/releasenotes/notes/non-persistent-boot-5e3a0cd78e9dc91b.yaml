    Fixes a bug which caused boot device changes to be persistent in
    places where they did not need to be during cleaning and deployment
    phases, due to the default behavior of PXE interface forcing a persistent
    change. For more information, see
    `bug 1701721 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1701721>`_.
