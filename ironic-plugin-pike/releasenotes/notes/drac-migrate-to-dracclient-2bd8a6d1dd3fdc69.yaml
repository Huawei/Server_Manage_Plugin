fixes:
  - DRAC driver migrated from ``pywsman`` to ``python-dracclient`` fixing
    the driver lockup issue caused by the python interpreter not handling
    signals when execution handed to the c library.
  - Fixes an issue with setting the boot device multiple times without a reboot
    in the DRAC driver by setting the boot device only before power management
    operations.
upgrade:
  - Dependency for DRAC driver changed from ``pywsman`` to
    ``python-dracclient`` with version >= 0.0.5. Exceptions thrown by the
    driver and return values of the ``set_bios_config``, ``commit_bios_config``
    and ``abandon_bios_config`` methods changed on the vendor-passthru
    interface.
