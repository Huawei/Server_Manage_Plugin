    Fixes an issue in boot from volume for a node with the ``iscsi`` deploy
    interface. It would fail if no ``image_source`` was provided in the node's
    ``instance_info`` field because it would try to validate the
    ``image_source`` which didn't exist. There is no need to specify the
    ``image_source`` and the validation is no longer being attempted. See
    `bug 1714147 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1714147>`_ for details.
