features:
  - A new configuration option, `shred_final_overwrite_with_zeros` is now
    available. This option controls the final overwrite with zeros done on
    all block devices for a node under cleaning. This feature was previously
    always enabled and not configurable. This option is only used when a
    block device could not be ATA Secure Erased.
deprecations:
  - The [deploy]/erase_devices_iterations config is deprecated and will
    be removed in the Ocata cycle. It has been replaced by the
    [deploy]/shred_random_overwrite_iterations config. This configuration
    option controls the number of times block devices are overwritten with
    random data. This option is only used when a block device could not be
    ATA Secure Erased.
