fixes:
  - A ``[conductor]/api_url`` value specified in the configuration file that
    does not start with either ``https://`` or ``http://`` is no longer
    allowed. An incorrect value led to deployment failure on
    ironic-python-agent side. This misconfiguration will now be detected during
    ironic-conductor and ironic-api startup. An exception will be raised and an
    error about the invalid value will be logged.
