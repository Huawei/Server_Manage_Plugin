prelude: >
    This release features switch to Oslo Futurist library for asynchronous
    thread execution and periodic tasks. Main benefit is that periodic tasks
    are now executed truly in parallel, and not sequentially in one
    green thread.
upgrade:
  - Configuration option "workers_pool_size" can no longer be less or equal
    to 2. Please set it to greater value (the default is 100) before update.
deprecations:
  - Configuration option "periodic_interval" is deprecated.
  - Using "driver_periodic_task" decorator is deprecated. Please update your
    out-of-tree drivers to use "periodics.periodic" decorator from Futurist
    library.
fixes:
  - Periodic tasks are no longer executed all in one thread.
