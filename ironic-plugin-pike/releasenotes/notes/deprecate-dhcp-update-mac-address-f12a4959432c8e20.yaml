features:

    Adds new methods to network interfaces, which will become
    mandatory in Pike release:

    * ``vif_list``: List attached VIF IDs for a node.
    * ``vif_attach``: Attach a virtual network interface to a node.
    * ``vif_detach``: Detach a virtual network interface from a node.
    * ``port_changed``: Handle any actions required when a port
       changes.
    * ``portgroup_changed``: Handle any actions required when a
      port group changes.
    * ``get_current_vif``: Return VIF ID attached to port or port group
      object.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``update_mac_address`` method in the DHCP provider interface is
    deprecated and will be removed in the Pike release.
    The logic should be moved to a custom network
    interface's ``port_changed`` and ``portgroup_changed`` methods.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where a pre-created tenant port was automatically
    deleted by ironic on instance delete.
