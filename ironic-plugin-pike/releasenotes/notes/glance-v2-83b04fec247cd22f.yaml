    Ironic now uses only the Image Service (glance) v2 API by default. Use of
    the deprecated v1 API for certain basic tasks can still be enabled by setting
    ``[glance]/glance_api_version`` to ``1``. This option, however, does not
    affect temporary URL generation, as it always requires the v2 API.
