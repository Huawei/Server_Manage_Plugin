upgrade:
  - Adds a config [amt]awake_interval for the interval to
    wake up the AMT interface for a node. This should
    correspond to the IdleTimeout config option on the
    AMT interface. Setting to 0 will disable waking the
    AMT interface, just like setting IdleTimeout=0 on the
    AMT interface will disable the AMT interface from sleeping
    when idle.
fixes:
  - Fixes an issue with talking to a sleeping AMT interface
    by waking up the interface before sending commands, if
    needed. This is configured with the [amt]awake_interval
    config option.
