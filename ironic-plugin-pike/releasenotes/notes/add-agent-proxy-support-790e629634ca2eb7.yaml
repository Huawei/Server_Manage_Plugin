features:
  - Pass proxy information from agent driver to IPA ramdisk, so that images
    can be cached on the proxy server.
issues:
  - When using caching proxy with ``agent_*`` drivers, caching the image on the
    proxy server might involve increasing [glance]swift_temp_url_duration
    config option value. This way, the cached entry will be valid for a period
    of time long enough to see the benefits of caching. Large temporary URL
    duration might become a security issue in some cases.
upgrade:
  - Adds a [glance]swift_temp_url_cache_enabled configuration option to enable
    Swift temporary URL caching. It is only useful if the caching proxy is
    used. Also adds [glance]swift_temp_url_expected_download_start_delay, which
    is used to check if the Swift temporary URL duration is long enough to let
    the image download to start, and, if temporary URL caching is enabled, to
    determine if a cached entry will be still valid when download starts. The
    value of [glance]swift_temp_url_expected_download_start_delay must be less
    than the value for the [glance]swift_temp_url_duration configuration
    option.
