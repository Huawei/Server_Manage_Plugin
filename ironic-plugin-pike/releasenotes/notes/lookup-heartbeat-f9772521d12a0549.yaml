features:
  - New API endpoint for deploy ramdisk lookup ``/v1/lookup``.
    This endpoint is not authenticated to allow ramdisks to access it without
    passing the credentials to them.
  - New API endpoint for deploy ramdisk heartbeat ``/v1/heartbeat/<NODE>``.
    This endpoint is not authenticated to allow ramdisks to access it without
    passing the credentials to them.
deprecations:
  - The configuration option ``[agent]/heartbeat_timeout`` was renamed to
    ``[api]/ramdisk_heartbeat_timeout``. The old variant is deprecated.
upgrade:
  - A new configuration option ``[api]/restrict_lookup`` is added, which
    restricts the lookup API (normally only used by ramdisks) to only work when
    the node is in specific states used by the ramdisk, and defaults to True.
    Operators that need this endpoint to work in any state may set this to
    False, though this is insecure and should not be used in normal operation.
