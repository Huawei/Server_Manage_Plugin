upgrade:
  - |
    Due to upcoming changes in the way Nova schedules bare metal nodes, all
    nodes in a deployment using Nova have to get the ``resource_class`` field
    populated before the upgrade. See `enrollment documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/enrollment.html#enrollment-process>`_
    and `flavor configuration documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-nova-flavors.html#scheduling-based-on-resource-classes>`_
    for details.

    Once you've migrated your flavors to resource classes, you should unset
    the deprecated ``use_baremetal_filters`` option in the Compute service
    configuration. Otherwise you'll be using the filters incompatible with
    scheduling based on resource classes.
