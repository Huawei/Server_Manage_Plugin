fixes:
  - A bug has been corrected where a node's current clean_step
    was not purged upon that node timing out from a CLEANWAIT state.
    Previously, this bug would prevent a user from retrying cleaning
    operations. For more information,
    see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1590146.
