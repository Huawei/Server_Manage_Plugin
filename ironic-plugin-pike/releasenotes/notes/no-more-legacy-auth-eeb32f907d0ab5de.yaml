upgrade:
  - |
    Ironic no longer falls back to loading authentication configuration
    options for accessing other services from the ``[keystone_authtoken]``
    section.
    As a result, the following configuration sections now must contain
    proper authentication options for appropriate services:

    - glance
    - neutron
    - swift
    - inspector
    - service_catalog
