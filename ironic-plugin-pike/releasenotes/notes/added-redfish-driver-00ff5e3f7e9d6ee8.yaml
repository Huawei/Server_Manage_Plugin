    Adds support for the `Redfish <https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish>`_
    standard via a new ``redfish`` hardware type. (There is no equivalent
    "classic" driver for this.) It uses two new interfaces:

    * ``redfish`` power interface supports all hard and soft power operations
    * ``redfish`` management interface supports:

      - getting and setting the boot device (PXE, disk, CD-ROM or BIOS)
      - making the configured boot device persistent or not
      - injecting NMI
