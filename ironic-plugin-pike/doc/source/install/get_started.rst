Bare Metal service overview
===========================

The Bare Metal service is a collection of components that provides support to
manage and provision physical machines.

Also known as the ``ironic`` project, the Bare Metal service may, depending
upon configuration, interact with several other OpenStack services. This
includes:

- the OpenStack Telemetry module (``ceilometer``) for consuming the IPMI
  metrics
- the OpenStack Identity service (``keystone``) for request authentication and
  to locate other OpenStack services
- the OpenStack Image service (``glance``) from which to retrieve images and
  image meta-data
- the OpenStack Networking service (``neutron``) for DHCP and network
  configuration
- the OpenStack Compute service (``nova``) works with the Bare Metal service
  and acts as a user-facing API for instance management, while the Bare Metal
  service provides the admin/operator API for hardware management.  The
  OpenStack Compute service also provides scheduling facilities (matching
  flavors <-> images <-> hardware), tenant quotas, IP assignment, and other
  services which the Bare Metal service does not, in and of itself, provide.
- the OpenStack Object Storage (``swift``) provides temporary storage
  for the configdrive, user images, deployment logs and inspection data.

The Bare Metal service includes the following components:

ironic-api
  A RESTful API that processes application requests by sending them to the
  ironic-conductor over `remote procedure call (RPC)`_.

ironic-conductor
  Adds/edits/deletes nodes; powers on/off nodes with ipmi or other
  vendor-specific protocol;
  provisions/deploys/cleans bare metal nodes.

ironic-python-agent
  A python service which is run in a temporary ramdisk to provide
  ironic-conductor and ironic-inspector services with remote access, in-band
  hardware control, and hardware introspection.

.. _`remote procedure call (RPC)`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call

Additionally, the Bare Metal service has certain external dependencies, which
are very similar to other OpenStack services:

- A database to store hardware information and state. You can set the database
  back-end type and location. A simple approach is to use the same database
  back end as the Compute service. Another approach is to use a separate
  database back-end to further isolate bare metal resources (and associated
  metadata) from users.
- An oslo.messaging compatible queue, such as RabbitMQ. It may use the same
  implementation as that of the Compute service, but that is not a requirement.

Optionally, one may wish to utilize the following associated projects for
additional functionality:

python-ironicclient_
  A command-line interface (CLI) and python bindings for interacting with the
  Bare Metal service.

ironic-inspector_
  An associated service which performs in-band hardware introspection by
  PXE booting unregistered hardware into the ironic-python-agent ramdisk.

diskimage-builder_
  A related project to help facilitate the creation of ramdisks and machine
  images, such as those running the ironic-python-agent.

bifrost_
  A set of Ansible playbooks that automates the task of deploying a base image
  onto a set of known hardware using ironic in a standalone mode.
