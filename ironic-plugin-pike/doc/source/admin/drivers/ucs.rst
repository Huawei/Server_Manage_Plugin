UCS drivers
===========

Overview
========
The UCS driver is targeted for UCS Manager managed Cisco UCS B/C series
servers. The pxe_ucs, agent_ucs drivers enables you to take advantage of
UCS Manager by using the python SDK.

``pxe_ucs`` driver uses PXE/iSCSI (just like ``pxe_ipmitool`` driver) to
deploy the image and uses UCS to do all management operations on the
baremetal node (instead of using IPMI).

``agent_ucs`` driver uses IPA ramdisk (just like ``agent_ipmitool`` and
``agent_ipminative`` drivers.) to deploy the image and uses UCS to do all
management operations on the baremetal node (instead of using IPMI).

The UCS drivers can use the Ironic Inspector service for in-band inspection of
equipment. For more information see the `Ironic Inspector documentation
<http://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

* ``UcsSdk`` is a python package version of XML API sdk available to
  manage Cisco UCS Managed B/C-series servers.

  Install ``UcsSdk`` [1]_ module on the Ironic conductor node.
  Required version is 0.8.2.2::

   $ pip install "UcsSdk==0.8.2.2"

Tested Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This driver works on Cisco UCS Manager Managed B/C-series servers.
It has been tested with the following servers:

UCS Manager version: 2.2(1b), 2.2(3d).

* UCS B22M, B200M3
* UCS C220M3.

All the Cisco UCS B/C-series servers managed by UCSM 2.1 or later are supported
by this driver.

Configuring and Enabling the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Add ``pxe_ucs`` and/or ``agent_ucs`` to the list of ``enabled_drivers`` in
   ``/etc/ironic/ironic.conf``.  For example::

    enabled_drivers = pxe_ipmitool,pxe_ucs,agent_ucs

2. Restart the Ironic conductor service::

    service ironic-conductor restart

Registering UCS node in Ironic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nodes configured for UCS driver should have the ``driver`` property set to
``pxe_ucs/agent_ucs``.  The following configuration values are also required in
``driver_info``:

- ``ucs_address``: IP address or hostname of the UCS Manager
- ``ucs_username``: UCS Manager login user name with administrator or
   server_profile privileges.
- ``ucs_password``: UCS Manager login password for the above UCS Manager user.
- ``deploy_kernel``: The Glance UUID of the deployment kernel.
- ``deploy_ramdisk``: The Glance UUID of the deployment ramdisk.
- ``ucs_service_profile``: Distinguished name(DN) of service_profile being enrolled.

The following sequence of commands can be used to enroll a UCS node.

  Create Node::

    ironic node-create -d <pxe_ucs/agent_ucs> -i ucs_address=<UCS Manager hostname/ip-address> -i ucs_username=<ucsm_username> -i ucs_password=<ucsm_password> -i ucs_service_profile=<service_profile_dn_being_enrolled> -i deploy_kernel=<glance_uuid_of_deploy_kernel> -i deploy_ramdisk=<glance_uuid_of_deploy_ramdisk> -p cpus=<number_of_cpus> -p memory_mb=<memory_size_in_MB> -p local_gb=<local_disk_size_in_GB> -p cpu_arch=<cpu_arch>

  The above command 'ironic node-create' will return UUID of the node, which is the value of $NODE in the following command.

  Associate port with the node created::

    ironic port-create -n $NODE -a <MAC_address_of_Ucs_server's_NIC>
