==================================
Welcome to Ironic's documentation!
==================================

Introduction
============

Ironic is an OpenStack project which provisions bare metal (as opposed to
virtual) machines. It may be used independently or as part of an OpenStack
Cloud, and integrates with the OpenStack Identity (keystone), Compute (nova),
Network (neutron), Image (glance), and Object (swift) services.

The Bare Metal service manages hardware through both common (eg. PXE and IPMI)
and vendor-specific remote management protocols. It provides the cloud operator
with a unified interface to a heterogeneous fleet of servers while also
providing the Compute service with an interface that allows physical servers to
be managed as though they were virtual machines.

This documentation is continually updated and may not represent the state of
the project at any specific prior release. To access documentation for a
previous release of ironic, append the OpenStack release name to the URL; for
example, the ``ocata`` release is available at
https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/ocata/.
