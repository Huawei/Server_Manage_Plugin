    Validate the consistency of a port's physical network with other ports in

    During creation or update of a port in a portgroup we apply the
    following validation criteria:

    - If the portgroup has existing ports with different physical networks, we
      raise PortgroupPhysnetInconsistent. This shouldn't ever happen.
    - If the port has a physical network that is inconsistent with other
      ports in the portgroup, we raise exception.Conflict.

    If a port's physical network is None, this indicates that ironic's VIF
    attachment mapping algorithm should operate in a legacy (physical
    network unaware) mode for this port or portgroup. This allows existing
    ironic nodes to continue to function after an upgrade to a release
    including physical network support.
