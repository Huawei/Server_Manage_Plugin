# apparmor is an undeclared dependency for docker on ubuntu: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9745
# Starting with Debian Jessie (and thus in Ubuntu Xenial too),
# pxelinux package provides the pxelinux.0 boot loader,
# but such package is absent from Debian Wheezy / Ubuntu Trusty.
# Also, in Debian Wheezy / Ubuntu Trusty 'syslinux' depends on syslinux-common,
# but only recommends it in Jessie/Xenial.
# Make sure syslinux-common is installed for those distros as it provides
# *.c32 modules for syslinux
# TODO remove distro pinning when Wheezy / Trusty are EOLed (May 2019)
# or DevStack stops supporting those.
# In the mean time, new Debian-based release codenames will have to be added
# as distros can not be pinned with 'if-later-than' specified.
