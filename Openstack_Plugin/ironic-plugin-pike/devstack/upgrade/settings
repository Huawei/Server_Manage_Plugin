# Grenade needs to know that Ironic has a Grenade plugin. This is done in the

# update the Ironic grenade job(s) in jenkins/jobs/devstack-gate.yaml with
# this:
#     export GRENADE_PLUGINRC="enable_grenade_plugin ironic https://git.openstack.org/openstack/ironic"
# If openstack-infra/project-config is not updated then the Grenade tests will
# never get run for Ironic
