        Supports passing iSCSI information in the form of IP and IQN records,
        as well as Fibre Channel information in the form of WWPN addresses.
        Fibre Channel WWNN addresses are also sent, however at present in-tree
        Cinder drivers do not utilize WWNN addresses.

        If multiple connectors exist, the request will be filed with
        MultiPath IO being enabled.

        A warning is logged if an unsupported volume type is encountered.

        :params task: The task object.

        :returns: A dictionary data structure similar to:
