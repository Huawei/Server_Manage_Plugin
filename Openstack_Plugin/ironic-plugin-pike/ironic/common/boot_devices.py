Mapping of boot devices used when requesting the system to boot
from an alternate device.

The options presented were based on the IPMItool chassis
bootdev command. You can find the documentation at:
http://linux.die.net/man/1/ipmitool

NOTE: This module does not include all the options from ipmitool because
they don't make sense in the limited context of Ironic right now.
