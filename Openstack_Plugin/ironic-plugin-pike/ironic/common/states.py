"""
Mapping of bare metal node states.

Setting the node `power_state` is handled by the conductor's power
synchronization thread. Based on the power state retrieved from the driver
for the node, the state is set to POWER_ON or POWER_OFF, accordingly.
Should this fail, the `power_state` value is left unchanged, and the node
is placed into maintenance mode.

The `power_state` can also be set manually via the API. A failure to change
the state leaves the current state unchanged. The node is NOT placed into
maintenance mode in this case.
