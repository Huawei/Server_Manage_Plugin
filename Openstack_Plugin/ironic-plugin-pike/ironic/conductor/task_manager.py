"""
A context manager to perform a series of tasks on a set of resources.

:class:`TaskManager` is a context manager, created on-demand to allow
synchronized access to a node and its resources.

The :class:`TaskManager` will, by default, acquire an exclusive lock on
a node for the duration that the TaskManager instance exists. You may
create a TaskManager instance without locking by passing "shared=True"
when creating it, but certain operations on the resources held by such
an instance of TaskManager will not be possible. Requiring this exclusive
lock guards against parallel operations interfering with each other.

A shared lock is useful when performing non-interfering operations,
such as validating the driver interfaces.

An exclusive lock is stored in the database to coordinate between
:class:`ironic.conductor.manager` instances, that are typically deployed on
different hosts.

:class:`TaskManager` methods, as well as driver methods, may be decorated to
determine whether their invocation requires an exclusive lock.

The TaskManager instance exposes certain node resources and properties as
attributes that you may access:

    task.context
        The context passed to TaskManager()
    task.shared
        False if Node is locked, True if it is not locked. (The
        'shared' kwarg arg of TaskManager())
    task.node
        The Node object
    task.ports
        Ports belonging to the Node
    task.portgroups
        Portgroups belonging to the Node
    task.volume_connectors
        Storage connectors belonging to the Node
    task.volume_targets
        Storage targets assigned to the Node
    task.driver
        The Driver for the Node, or the Driver based on the
        'driver_name' kwarg of TaskManager().

Example usage:

::

    with task_manager.acquire(context, node_id, purpose='power on') as task:
        task.driver.power.power_on(task.node)

If you need to execute task-requiring code in a background thread, the
TaskManager instance provides an interface to handle this for you, making
sure to release resources when the thread finishes (successfully or if
an exception occurs). Common use of this is within the Manager like so:

::

    with task_manager.acquire(context, node_id, purpose='some work') as task:
        <do some work>
        task.spawn_after(self._spawn_worker,
                         utils.node_power_action, task, new_state)

All exceptions that occur in the current GreenThread as part of the
spawn handling are re-raised. You can specify a hook to execute custom
code when such exceptions occur. For example, the hook is a more elegant
solution than wrapping the "with task_manager.acquire()" with a
try..exception block. (Note that this hook does not handle exceptions
raised in the background thread.):

::

    def on_error(e):
        if isinstance(e, Exception):
            ...

    with task_manager.acquire(context, node_id, purpose='some work') as task:
        <do some work>
        task.set_spawn_error_hook(on_error)
        task.spawn_after(self._spawn_worker,
                         utils.node_power_action, task, new_state)
