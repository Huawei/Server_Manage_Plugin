features:
  - Addition of the provision state target verb of ``adopt``
    which allows an operator to move a node into an ``active``
    state from ``manageable`` state, without performing a deployment
    operation on the node. This can be used to represent nodes that have
    been previously deployed by other means that will now be managed by
    ironic and be later released to the available hardware pool.
other:
  - When a node is enrolled into ironic, upon transition to the
    ``manageable`` state, the current power state of the node is
    recorded.  Once the node is adopted and in an ``active`` state,
    that recorded power state will be enforced by ironic unless an
    operator changes the power state in ironic. This was the default
    behavior of ironic prior to the adoption feature.
