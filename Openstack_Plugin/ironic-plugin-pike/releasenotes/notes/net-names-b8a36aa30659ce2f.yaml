features:
  - Names can now be used instead of UUIDs for ``[neutron]/cleaning_network``
    and
    ``[neutron]/provisioning_network`` configuration options (formerly
    called ``[neutron]/cleaning_network_uuid`` and
    ``[neutron]/provisioning_network_uuid``).
    Care has to be taken to ensure that the
    names are unique among all networks in this case. Note that the mapping
    between a name and a UUID is cached for the lifetime of the conductor.
deprecations:
  - Configuration options ``[neutron]/cleaning_network_uuid`` and
    ``[neutron]/provisioning_network_uuid`` are deprecated in favor of the new
    configuration options ``[neutron]/cleaning_network`` and
    ``[neutron]/provisioning_network`` respectively.
