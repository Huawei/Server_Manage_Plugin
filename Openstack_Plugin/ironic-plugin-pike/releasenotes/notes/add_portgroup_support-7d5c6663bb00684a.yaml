    Adds support for port groups with a new endpoint ``/v1/portgroups/``.
    Ports can be combined into port groups to support static Link Aggregation
    Group (LAG) and Multi-Chassis LAG (MLAG) configurations.

    Note that if the optional ``mode`` field for a port group is not specified,
    its value will be set to the value of the configuration option
    ``[DEFAULT]default_portgroup_mode``, which defaults to ``active-backup``.

    Additionally, adds the following API changes:

    * a new endpoint ``/v1/nodes/<node>/portgroups``.
    * a new endpoint ``/v1/portgroups/<portgroup>/ports``.
    * a new field ``portgroup_uuid`` on the port object. This is the UUID
      of a port group that this port belongs to, or None if it does not
      belong to any port group.

    All port group API functions are available starting with version 1.26 of
    the REST API.
