upgrade:
  - Fixed Mitaka ironic python agent ramdisk iSCSI deploy compatibility with
    newer versions of ironic by logging the warning and retrying the deploy if
    wiping root disk metadata before exposing it over iSCSI fails. If custom
    iSCSI port is requested, an error clarifying the issue is logged and the
    operator is requested either to use the default iSCSI portal port, or to
    upgrade ironic python agent ramdisk to version >= 1.3 (Newton).
