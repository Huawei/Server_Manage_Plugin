features:
  - Adds support for security groups for the provisioning and cleaning
    network. These are optionally specified by the configuration options
   ``[neutron]/provisioning_network_security_groups`` and
   ``[neutron]/cleaning_network_security_groups``, respectively.
   If not specified,
   the default security group for the network is used. These options are only
   applicable for nodes using the "neutron" network interface. These options
   are ignored for nodes using the "flat" and "noop" network interfaces.
