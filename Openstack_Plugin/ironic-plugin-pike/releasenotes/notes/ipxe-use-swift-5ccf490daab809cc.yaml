features:
  - By default, the ironic-conductor service caches the node's deploy
    ramdisk and kernel images locally and serves them via a separate
    HTTP server. A new ``[pxe]/ipxe_use_swift`` configuration option
    (disabled by default) allows images to be accessed directly
    from object store via Swift temporary URLs.
    This is only applicable if iPXE is enabled (via ``[pxe]/ipxe_enabled``
    configuration option) and image store is in Glance/Swift.
    For user images that are partition images requiring non-local boot,
    the default behavior with local caching and an HTTP server
    will still apply for user image kernel and ramdisk.
