upgrade:
  - |
    SSH-based power and management driver interfaces were removed from ironic.
    The drivers ``pxe_ssh``, ``agent_ssh`` and ``fake_ssh`` are no longer
    available.
    Operators are required to ensure that these drivers are not used
    or enabled (in ``[DEFAULT]enabled_drivers`` configuration file option)
    in their ironic installation before upgrade.
