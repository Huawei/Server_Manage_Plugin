    Changing the ``resource_class`` field of a node in the ``active`` state
    or any of the transient states is no longer possible. Please update your
    scripts to only set a resource class for nodes that are not deployed to.
    Setting a resource class for nodes that do not have it is still possible.
fixes:
  - |
    No longer allows changing the ``resource_class`` field for ``active`` nodes
    if it was already set to a non-empty value. Doing so would break the
    Compute scheduler.
