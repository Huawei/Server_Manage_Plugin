fixes:
  - When no boot mode is explicitly set on a node using
    an iLO driver, ironic automatically picks a boot
    mode based on hardware capabilities. This confuses
    deployers, as these factors are system specific and
    not configurable. In order to ensure predictable
    behavior, a new configuration parameter,
    ``[ilo]/default_boot_mode``, was added to allow
    deployers to explicitly set a default. The default
    value of this option keeps behavior consistent for
    existing deployments.
