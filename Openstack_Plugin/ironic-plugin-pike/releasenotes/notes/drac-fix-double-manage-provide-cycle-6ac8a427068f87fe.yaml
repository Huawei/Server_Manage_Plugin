fixes:
  - Fixes an issue that caused a node using a Dell EMC integrated Dell Remote
    Access Controller (iDRAC) *classic driver*, ``pxe_drac`` or
    ``pxe_drac_inspector``, to be placed in the ``clean failed`` state after a
    double ``manage``/``provide`` cycle, instead of the ``available`` state.
