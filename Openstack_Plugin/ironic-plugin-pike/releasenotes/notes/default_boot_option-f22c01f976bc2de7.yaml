features:
  - Adds new option ``[deploy]/default_boot_option`` for setting the default
    boot option when no explicit boot option is requested via capabilities.
upgrade:
  - A future release will change the default value of
    ``[deploy]/default_boot_option`` from "netboot" to "local". To
    avoid disruptions, it is recommended to set an explicit value for this
    option.
