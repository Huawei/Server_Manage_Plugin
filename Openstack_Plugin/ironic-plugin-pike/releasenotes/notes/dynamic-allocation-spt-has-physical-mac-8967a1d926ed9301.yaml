upgrade:
  - The minimum version of python-oneviewclient is now 2.5.2.
fixes:
  - A validation step is added to verify that the Server Profile
    Template's MAC type is set to Physical when dynamic allocation
    is enabled. The OneView Driver needs this verification
    because the machine is going to use a MAC that will only be
    specified at the profile application.
