    `OSProfiler <https://docs.openstack.org/osprofiler/latest/>`_ support
    requires passing of trace information between
    various OpenStack services. This information is securely signed
    by one of the HMAC keys, defined in the ``ironic.conf`` configuration file.
    To allow cross-project tracing, the same key should be used for all
    OpenStack services.
