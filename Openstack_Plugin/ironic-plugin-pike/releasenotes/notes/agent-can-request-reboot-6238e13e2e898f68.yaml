    - This adds the reboot_requested option for in-band
      cleaning. If set to true, Ironic will reboot the node
      after that step has completed and before continuing
      with the next step. This option is useful for when
      some action, such as a BIOS upgrade or setting change,
      requires a reboot to take effect.
