features:
  - OneView drivers now support dynamic allocation of nodes in OneView,
    allowing for better resource sharing with non-OpenStack users since Server
    Hardware will be allocated only when the node is scheduled to be used. To
    enable the new allocation feature for a node, set the flag
    ``dynamic_allocation=True`` on the node's ``driver_info``.
    More information is available at
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/drivers/oneview.html.
deprecations:
  - Deprecates pre-allocation feature for the OneView drivers since it requires
    resource allocation to Ironic prior to boot time, which makes Server
    Hardware unavailable to non-OpenStack OneView users. Pre-allocation will
    be removed in the OpenStack Pike release. All nodes with
    ``dynamic_allocation=False`` set, or that don't have the ``dynamic_allocation``
    flag set, will be assumed to be in pre-allocation. Users may use the REST API
    or the ``ironic-oneview-cli`` to migrate nodes from pre-allocation to
    dynamic allocation.
