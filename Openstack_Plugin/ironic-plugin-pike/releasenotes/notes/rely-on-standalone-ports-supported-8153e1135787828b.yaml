    Some combinations of port group protocols and hardware might not support
    falling back to single interface mode. If a static port group was created
    under such circumstances (where
    ``portgroup.standalone_ports_supported = False``), additional restrictions
    apply to such ports and port groups, for example such ports will not
    support booting over PXE.

    Certain restrictions are imposed on values of port properties for ports
    belonging to a port group:

    * ``port.pxe_enabled`` cannot be set to True if the port is a member of
      a port group with portgroup.standalone_ports_supported already
      set to False.
    * ``portgroup.standalone_ports_supported`` cannot be set to False on a
      port group if at least one port in that port group has
      ``port.pxe_enabled=True``
    * ``port.extra.vif_port_id`` cannot be set on a port that is a member of
      a port group with ``portgroup.standalone_ports_supported=False`` as
      setting it means that we using port in single interface mode.
    * ``portgroup.standalone_ports_supported`` cannot be set to False on a
      port group if it has at least one port with ``port.extra.vif_port_id``
      set.
