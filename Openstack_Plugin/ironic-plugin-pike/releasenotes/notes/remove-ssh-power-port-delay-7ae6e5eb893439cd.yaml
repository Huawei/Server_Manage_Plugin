    For SSH power drivers, if the configuration option
    ``[neutron]/port_setup_delay`` had been set to 0,
    a delay of 15 seconds was used. This is no longer
    the case. Please set the configuration option to
    the desired value; otherwise the service will not
    wait for Neutron agents to set up a port.
