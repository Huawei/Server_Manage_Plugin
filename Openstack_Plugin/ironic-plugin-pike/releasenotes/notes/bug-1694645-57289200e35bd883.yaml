fixes:

    Fixes netboot with virtual media boot in an environment using syslinux
    5.00 or later, such as Ubuntu 16.04. It was broken by a change in the
    location of the ``ldlinux.c32`` file.
features:
  - |
    New configuration option ``[DEFAULT]/ldlinux_32`` can be used to set the
    location of the ``ldlinux.c32`` file (from the syslinux package).
    The default behavior is to look for it in the following locations:

    * ``/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/ldlinux.c32``
    * ``/usr/share/syslinux/ldlinux.c32``
