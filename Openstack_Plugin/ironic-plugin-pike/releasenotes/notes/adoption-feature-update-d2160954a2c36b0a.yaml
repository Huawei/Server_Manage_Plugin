fixes:
  - Adoption feature logic was updated to prevent ramdisk
    creation and default to instance creation where appropriate
    based on the driver.
  - Adoption documentation has been updated to note that the
    boot_option should likely be defined for nodes by a user
    leveraging the feature.
  - Adoption documentation has been updated to note that a user
    may wish to utilize the ``noop`` network interface that
    arrived with API version 1.20.
