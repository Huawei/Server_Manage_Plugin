upgrade:
  - The default bootloader for PXE + UEFI has changed from ELILO to Grub2
    because ELILO is not being actively developed anymore. Operators relying
    on ELILO should explicitly set the ``[pxe]/uefi_pxe_bootfile_name``
    and ``[pxe]/uefi_pxe_config_template`` configuration options to the
    ELILO ROM and configuration template.
