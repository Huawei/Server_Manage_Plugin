fixes:
    - Fixes issue with socat console support where an unlimited
      number of connections could be created, resulting in the prior
      session being destroyed.  Connections are now limited
      to a single connection per server.  Socat now closes the
      console connection upon disconnect or timeout 10min.  To reconnect,
      users should re-activate the console.
