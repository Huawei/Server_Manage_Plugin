features:
  - Adds support for attaching and detaching network VIFs
    to ironic ports and port groups by using the ``/v1/nodes/<node>/vifs``
    API endpoint that was added in API version 1.28.
    When attaching a VIF to a node, it is attached to the first free port
    group. A port group is considered free if it has no VIFs attached to any of
    its ports. Otherwise, only the unattached ports of this port group are
    available for attachment. If there are no free port groups, the first
    available port is used instead, where ports with ``pxe_enabled`` set to
    ``True`` have higher priority.
deprecations:
  - Using ``port.extra['vif_port_id']`` for attaching and detaching
    VIFs to ports or port groups is deprecated and will be removed in Pike
    release.
