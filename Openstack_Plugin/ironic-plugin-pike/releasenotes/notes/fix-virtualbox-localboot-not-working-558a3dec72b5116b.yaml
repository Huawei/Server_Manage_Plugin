fixes:
  - Fixed a VirtualBox issue that Ironic fails
    to set VirtualBox VM's boot device
    when it is powered on. This bug causes
    two problems 1. VirtualBox cannot
    deploy VMs in local boot mode. 2. Ironic
    fails to set boot device when VirtualBox
    VMs is powered on and also fails to get
    the correct boot device from Ironic
    API call when VMs is powered on.
