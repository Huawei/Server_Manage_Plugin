fixes:
  - Fixes a problem where the deployment of a node would fail to continue
    if a malformed MAC address was passed to the lookup mechanism in the
    Ironic API. For example, if a node contains an Infiniband card, the
    lookup used to fail because the agent ramdisk passes a MAC address
    (or GID) with 20 octets (instead of the expected 6 octets) as part
    of the lookup request. Invalid addresses are now ignored.
