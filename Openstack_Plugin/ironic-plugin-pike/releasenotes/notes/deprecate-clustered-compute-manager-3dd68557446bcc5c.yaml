    The ClusteredComputeManager is now deprecated.

    The Newton version of Nova adds functionality to the ironic virt driver to
    support multiple compute hosts without using the hack we call
    ClusteredComputeManager. As such, we are marking this unsupported
    component as deprecated, and plan to remove it before the end of the Ocata
    development cycle.
