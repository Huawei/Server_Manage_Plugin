deprecations:
  - The function ``build_instance_info_for_deploy`` is deprecated from
    ``ironic.drivers.modules.agent`` and will be removed in the Pike cycle.
    Its new home is ``ironic.drivers.modules.deploy_utils``. Out-of-tree
    drivers that use this function should be updated accordingly.
