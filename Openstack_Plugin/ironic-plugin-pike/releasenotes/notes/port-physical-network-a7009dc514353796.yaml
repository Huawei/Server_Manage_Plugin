    Adds a ``physical_network`` field to the port object in REST API version
    1.34.

    This field specifies the name of the physical network to which the port is
    connected, and is empty by default.  This field may be set by the operator
    to allow the Bare Metal service to incorporate physical network information
    when attaching virtual interfaces (VIFs).

    The REST API endpoints related to ports provide support for the
    ``physical_network`` field.  The `multi-tenancy documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/multitenancy.html>`_
    provides information on how to configure and use physical networks.
upgrade:
  - |
    Following an upgrade to this release, all ports will have an empty
    ``physical_network`` field. Attachment of Virtual Interfaces (VIFs) will
    continue to function as in the previous release until any ports have their
    physical network field set.

    During a live upgrade to this release, the ``physical_network`` field will
    not be available. It will also not be possible to create ports which are
    members of a port group during a live upgrade, as the API service will be
    unable to validate the consistency of the request.
