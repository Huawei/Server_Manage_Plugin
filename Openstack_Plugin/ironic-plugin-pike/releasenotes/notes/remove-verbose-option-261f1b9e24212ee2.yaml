upgrade:
  - The 'verbose' configuration option was removed,
    consequently the "--verbose, -v" parameter from all
    command lines was also removed. This affects the
    ironic-api, ironic-conductor, ironic-dbsync, and
    ironic-rootwrap commands. The verbose config/parameter
    was originally a shortcut to set the log level to INFO, however
    the log level has defaulted to INFO since this option was
    deprecated, so this option was a noop.
