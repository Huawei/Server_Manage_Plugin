upgrade:
  - Adds a new configuration option, hash_ring_reset_interval,
    to control how often the conductor's view of the hash ring
    is reset. This has a default of 180 seconds, the same as
    the default for the sync_local_state periodic task that
    used to handle this reset.
critical:
  - Fixes a bug where the conductor's view of the hash
    ring was never refreshed if the sync_local_state
    periodic task was disabled. For more info, see
