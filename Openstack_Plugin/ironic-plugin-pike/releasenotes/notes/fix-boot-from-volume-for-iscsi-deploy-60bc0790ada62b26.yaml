    Fixes an issue in boot from volume for ``iscsi`` deploy interface. Booting
    from a volume would fail for a node with the ``iscsi`` deploy interface
    because the pxelinux.cfg file for the MAC address wasn't created and the
    node would fail to boot. The pxelinux.cfg file is now created. See
    `bug 1714436 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1714436>`_ for details.
