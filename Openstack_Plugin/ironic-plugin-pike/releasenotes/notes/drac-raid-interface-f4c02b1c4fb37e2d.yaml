features:
  - Adds out-of-band RAID management to DRAC driver using the generic RAID
    interface which makes the functionality available via manual cleaning
    steps.
  - New configuration option, ``[drac]/query_raid_config_job_status_interval``
    was added. After Ironic has created the RAID config job on the DRAC card,
    it continues to check for status update on the config job to determine
    whether the RAID configuration was successfully finished within
    this interval. Default is 120 seconds.
