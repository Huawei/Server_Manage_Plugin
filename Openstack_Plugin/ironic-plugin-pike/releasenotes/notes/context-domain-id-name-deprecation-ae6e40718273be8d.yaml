deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of the following values was deprecated in the policy files:

    - ``domain_id`` and ``domain_name`` - ``user_domain_id`` should be used
      instead of those (note - ``user_domain_id`` is an ID of the domain,
      not its name).
    - ``tenant`` - ``project_name`` should be used instead.
    - ``user`` - ``user_id`` should be used instead.
