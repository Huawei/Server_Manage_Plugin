features:
  - The Agent deploy driver now streams raw images
    directly to disk (instead of staging in memory) by
    default.
upgrade:
  - The Agent deploy driver now streams raw images
    directly to disk (instead of staging in memory) by
    default; this can be turned off by setting the
    [agent]stream_raw_images configuration option to False.
    Streaming may be undesirable if the disk the image is being
    written is significantly slower than the network.
fixes:
  - Because the agent deploy driver now streams raw images
    directly to disk, images larger than the RAM available
    to the deploy ramdisk will no longer fail to deploy.
