Ironic
======

Ironic consists of an API and plug-ins for managing and provisioning
physical machines in a security-aware and fault-tolerant manner. It can be
used with nova as a hypervisor driver, or standalone service using bifrost.
By default, it will use PXE and IPMI to interact with bare metal machines.
Ironic also supports vendor-specific plug-ins which may implement additional
functionality.
